                <h2>What Challenges Did You Face as You Were Improving the Artifact?</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>One significant challenge was modularizing the code without degrading performance.</li>
                    <li>Another was understanding the original codeâ€™s intent without adequate comments or documentation.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h2>What Lessons Did You Learn From These Challenges?</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>The modular artifact is far more flexible and secure than its original monolithic form, but its design and implementation are very time-consuming, and its performance pales in comparison to its monolithic predecessor.</li>
                    <li>Proper documentation is valuable, even if the documentation is for the author. Comments that provide insight of the purpose of a section of code are far more valuable than comments that explain what the code does. Debuggers and static code analysis can shed insight into what code does. However, they do not necessarily shed insight on its intent.</li>
                </ol>
                

                <h2>Which computer science professional standards did your SED enhancements fully address?</h2>
                <ul>
                    SED improvements partially addressed CS standards III, IV, and V.
