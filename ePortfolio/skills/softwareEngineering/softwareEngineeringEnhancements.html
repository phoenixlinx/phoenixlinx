        <h4>Enhancement: Structural Composition</h4>

         <p><strong>Why Did You Enhance This Component?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>EzCSVCRUDtoDBConverter.cpp fits the definition of the Blob anti-pattern. It handles most of the application’s many responsibilities. The system consists of just two files: EzCSVCRUDtoDBConverter.cpp and CSVparser.cpp. This design made it very challenging and impractical to make changes to the old system. Even a small change to one part of the system often profoundly affected many other parts. Additionally, reusing individual EzCSV functions in other projects required much effort because its functions were highly dependent on other EzCSV functions and variables. As a result, the complexity of EzCSV not only made maintenance difficult but also made the system prone to vulnerabilities, as its complexity obscured its flaws.</li>

        <h4>Enhancement Implementation: Modular Structural Composition</h4>
                   
        <p><strong>How Was the Component Enhanced?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enhanced maintainability, reusability, and security by breaking down complex files, classes, and functions into smaller, manageable units that follow the Single Responsibility Principle.</li>
