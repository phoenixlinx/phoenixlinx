                    <h4>Enhancement: Binary Search Tree (BST)</h4>
                  
                        <p><strong>Why Did You Enhance This Component?</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The binary search tree might as well be replaced with a more straightforward,
                                memory-efficient doubly linked list since it effectively degrades into a double linked
                                list when keys are inserted in sorted order. 
                                This insertion pattern results in a severely unbalanced tree structure that behaves like a linked list, causing CRUD
                                operations to degrade to O(n) time complexity instead of the optimal O(log n).

                    <h4>Enhancement Implementation: Generic Recursion-Free Self-Balancing BST</h4>
                   
                        <p><strong>How Was the Component Enhanced?</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Enhanced the flexibility, adaptability of the artifact by creating a generic,
                                    self-balancing binary search tree that supports objects of type T and keys of type
                                    string, int, or double without requiring type-specific code for T objects.</p>

                                <p>Improved performance and security by substituting recursive functions with iterative
                                    versions. Iterative version avoids function call overhead and therefore improves
                                    efficiency. Similarly, the lack of function calls during deep tree operations avoids
                                    stack frame creation, which reduces the risk of stack overflow and the exceptions
                                    that they cause.</p>
