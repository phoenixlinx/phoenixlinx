                    The selected artifact is the final project from CS 260: Data Structures and Algorithms. It features a command-line interface in EzCSVCRUDtoDBConverter.cpp that processes a hardcoded CSV file path, extracts data, and stores it in a binary search tree for efficient CRUD operations. However, its current design, including reliance on recursion and hardcoding, limits scalability and practicality for real-world use.
